### Caveat
The software is _still under development_: the display, menu, serial functions and dashboard functionalities are operative.  
The MPPT control loop and the battery loading processes are still missing, since I am still in the process of analyzing the behavior of the hardware, before determining the best algorithm.

# Explanations about the software.
I like software being easy to read, close to natural language.  
The Arduino IDE is a very accessible development environment, that hides the complexity of C++ language to the beginners.
My code makes also extensive use of compiler directives to determine different options and avoid having to dig into the code to change a user setting.  
For the sake of clarity I made an extensive use of comments, especially commenting why I realized the code that way.  
I refrained as far as possible to use geek jargon that requires C++ expertise beyond what an Arduino user with reasonable experience can understand. 
The Arduino IDE provides the possibility to split the code into separate tabs for clarity.

## Functional blocks
I used that feature to organize my code in functional blocks:
1. ESP_SwissArmyKnife: comment-only, a short description of the target, license terms.
2. Thinger Dasboard:   comment-only, the JSON content of a dashboard example at thinger.io provided here for convenience.
3. a0_Parameters: options defined by compiler directives. __This will be the main place for users to tamper with.__
4. a1 Libs_Vars: libraries and variables required by the program.
5. b_Functions: the function subroutines used by the program.
6. c_Setup: The setup process that runs once upon booting the ESP
7. d_Menu: The serial menu that can be used to adjust parameters and request some reports on the serial line.
8. e_Data: The main processing routine
9. f_Display: The code intended to display current information on the OLED displays
10. g_Serial: The code intended to issue the serial reports called by the menu.
11. h_Wireless: The code to exchange information with the thinger.io Dashboard and other devices
12. k_Loop: The scheduling loop controlling all previous tasks.
13. x_ReadMe: comment-only, mainly for myself contains some syntaxes, that my limited brain tends to forget.
14. y_ParkedCode: comment-only, containing parts of the code intended for further usage. 

The code separation into functional blocks makes it much easier to jump between several tasks.

## Installing the Arduino IDE with ESP support.
https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide/
Then you need a few libraries to run SoftPower:  
Start the library manager: Tools/Manage Libraries...  
You need  
- ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon
- ESP8266...OLED driver, by Thingpulse and Fabrice Weinberg
- INA2xx by Arnd
- thinger.io by Alvaro Luis Bustamente
The other libraries should be already present.

## Download instructions
You can download all the files from the main page of Soft-Power upon clicking on the green Code button and selecting "download Zip".    
This will save a file Soft-Power-MPPT-main.zip.  
From that compressed file, extract the folder "Software" and copy it into your Arduino working space.  
Rename that folder SoftPowerMPPT.  
You will now find the project in File/Sketchbook/SoftPowerMPPT and after starting, it you will find all tabs present.  

If later you just need to update some tabs individually, you just can copy the content directly into the Arduino IDE.
