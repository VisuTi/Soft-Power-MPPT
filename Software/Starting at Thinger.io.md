# Starting at Thinger.io

Using Thinger.io is not a precondition, but it makes Soft-Power really comfortable and provides a lot of the visibility. 

First you need to register at www.Thinger.io, take note of your username and password.
After confirming your registration go to:
https://console.thinger.io/#!/console/ (this will be your main starting point: good to bookmark it!)
The most important feature for a beginning are:
- Dashboards
- Devices
- Data Buckets

First you will need to create a device: Select Devices, then Add Device.
- leave the device type unchanged
- as a device ID use "Soft-Power" (without the quotes) you must change that for your second device.
- enter whatever you want as a device description
- enter a password as a device credentials (not your password for Thinger.io)
click on "Add Device"

Then you must enter the for buckets used by Soft-Power: Select data buckets, then Add Bucket.
you will need to define the following buckets:
1. EVENT
2. DAY
3. HOUR
4. MIN
for each one, enter exactly the buckets ID. you may enter what you want as a bucket name and Beckett description.
As a data source select " from device write call" out of the drop-down lists.
click on "Add bucket"
Finally you must get that picture:
