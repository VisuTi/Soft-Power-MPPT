# Sourcing 

this file is given for convenience. I am not affiliated in any way with AliExpress, and do not even recommend them, but they have enough choice to be able to sell almost anything I have been using. Many items sell by quantities. If you are not tinkering a lot, you are probably better off buying locally just what you need.

Color wires: I use to tear-off old parallel printer or VGA cables from the scrapyard.  
They yet have good old quality copper wires, not the crap you buy today made of CC Aluminium!
